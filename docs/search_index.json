If you’re interested in food-related topics or consumer marketing in the digital space, you’re in the right place. Figure .: Hi Everyone- hear me talk about my idea, Event Foresight! About Idea One: Event Foresight Attendance is one of the most important elements in planning and assessing the success of various types of events. Without purchased tickets as a definite indication of attendance, non-ticketed events face a specific challenge as they must predict attendance and plan for production level based on a combination of other signals including social media engagement, weather conditions and vendor klout (online social influence measured by followers). Thus, with its integrations to social media networks, weather APIs and event company’s sales and attendance data, Event Foresight uses its comprehensive data tracking and runs a regression analysis to generate an attendance forecast that can be used in key decision-making in event preparation. About Idea Two: EcoFridge Food waste is a widespread problem in the U.S. as nearly half of the food grown, processed and transported in the U.S. goes to waste. For the environment, it means a waste of energy and resources and higher landfill volumes that lead to increased greenhouse gas emission that contributes to global warming and climate change. EcoFridge helps consumers reduce their food waste and become more conscious on their actual food consumption. With its 12-camera system, image classification models trained on food images and dictionary of food storage guidelines, EcoFridge tags products with the respective expiration dates and keeps track of the various expiration dates on an internal calendar. When a product is about to expire, they are alerted through their phones of next steps. Furthermore, EcoFridge will take note of items that are unused by the expiration date and send the user a monthly report of recommended amounts per product for future purchases. By reducing the manual effort required on the consumer’s end, EcoFridge can help lower our carbon footprint, lower methane emissions from landfills and hopefully conserve valuable energy and resources.

["eventforesight.html", "1 Event Foresight: Predict Attendance for Non-Ticketed Events 1.1 Breaking the Vicious Cycle 1.2 Event Foresight 1.3 Potential for More", " 1 Event Foresight: Predict Attendance for Non-Ticketed Events Keywords predictive analytics, image processing, events, event planning 1.1 Breaking the Vicious Cycle Off the Grid is a food truck events company in the Bay Area that hosts 70 weekly events in 26 cities. As the company opens in new locations, a recurring issue at their grand opening events is tremendous event attendance met with insufficient food supply. With every food truck that sells out, there’s a loss of revenue and a dire impact on customer retention as wait time increases and customer satisfaction diminishes. Thus, the company needs a better way to forecast attendance in order to better prepare their food truck vendors for the potential turnout. A step towards this goal is figuring out a way to accurately predict attendance for their events, which are non-ticketed, outdoors and temporary. 1.2 Event Foresight As a temporary event, Off the Grid does not have the advantage of constant physical presence, and therefore constant promotion, as brick-and-mortar locations. Furthermore, with no actual ticket sales prior to an event, the company can only depend on Facebook RSVPs to gauge attendance with the understanding that RSVP are generally correlated with attendance. However, for more precise forecasts that can improve event-planning and decision making, the company needs a model that incorporates the many variables that affect event attendance. Introducing Event Foresight, a software solution that offers insight to the success of an event based on digital engagement factors and environmental variables. Its underlying algorithm is a regression model that takes into account factors including social media engagement, weather, location, vendor klout (online social influence based on followers) that have the potential to affect event turnouts and sales. Event Foresight integrates with various services, allowing easy tracking around related factors such as engagement around tagged social media event posts and forecasted weather conditions in the event’s location. Furthermore, users can upload a file of social media accounts (i.e. Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) of vendors they commonly partner with for quick selection and assessment of potential klout around the event. With this prediction model, Off the Grid can generate an attendance forecast that they can use in key decision-making on the appropriate number of food trucks to schedule or the production level food trucks should be ready to serve at in order to reduce potential loss of revenue. 1.3 Potential for More The ability to forecast event attendance accurately can help Off the Grid from losing thousands of dollars in revenue per event, and earn the company even more through customer retention. Furthermore, Event Foresight could be applicable in many other fields, as it may also help law enforcement in forecasting crowd sizes to better estimate the number of security personnel required for an outdoor event.

For the consumer, it means loss of money. For the environment, it means higher landfill volumes that lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. Furthermore, food waste represents a waste of energy and resources that are involved in growing, manufacturing and transporting the food. According to Unilever, “reducing consumer food waste could save between US$120-300 billion per year by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1 billion tons CO2 per year…” So how can the average person join the effort in helping our environment by reducing food waste? Introducing EcoFridge, a refrigerator that keeps track of your food and their expiration dates, without you having to take any extra steps. 2.2 Reduce Waste with EcoFridge (#fig:national_geographic_fridge) Photograph by Mark Menjivar from National Geographic Many companies have tried to provide a solution to this all-too-common habit of letting your food go bad in the fridge. Mobile applications like Fridgely require the user to scan the barcode of the items in their fridge. Samsung and LG both offer Smart Refrigerators that have built-in cameras but still require manual labeling of expiration dates for food. However, current solutions require too much manual effort on the user’s end. So what if the refrigerator could do all the work? EcoFridge has 12 built-in cameras that offers a comprehensive view of the contents of your fridge and takes photos of the inventory twice a day. These photos are then processed through our image classification model that’s learned what various food items look like from images obtained from Open Food Facts - United States. The goal of the model is to accurately classify each item in the fridge into 7 food categories: Breads, Baked Goods, Dairy Products, Fruits, Meats, Seafood and Fish and Vegetables that commonly require refrigerated storage. From there, it would search through an existing dictionary of food storage guidelines and find the best match for the product name. Then EcoFridge would tag the product with the respective expiration date and keep track of the various expiration dates on an internal calendar. When a product is not recognized, EcoFridge will flag the item and request a label from the user through their phones. If no entry is recorded, an automatic 5-day expiration label will be placed. Once a product is about to expire, EcoFridge will alert the user through their phones, as well as recommend they move the item into the freezer upon their next visit to their fridge (which will subsequently be tagged with another expiration date). If the user finds the product is still fine for consumption, they can manually enter a new expiration date, which will then be updated in EcoFridge’s database. Additionally, EcoFridge will take note of items that are unused by the expiration date and send the user a monthly report of recommended amounts per product for future purchases. 2.3 Beyond EcoFridge As the EPA states, “Food is the largest stream of materials in American trash.” To promote wide adoption of EcoFridge’s sustainability goal, we plan to not only sell EcoFridge as a standalone product, but also license the image classification technology to existing fridge manufacturers. With restaurants and consumers onboard in being more conscious on actual food consumption and loss, we can lower our carbon footprint, lower methane emissions from landfills and hopefully conserve valuable energy and resources. It’s important to note that while EcoFridge will do the heavy work of managing your food inventory and expiration dates, it still requires some effort from the user. Once the user is notified about an upcoming expiration date, they will have to take action in making sure the food does not go to waste, whether it’s cooking the food or donating it. If the food has gone bad, they will have to compost the waste correctly to make sure it stays out of the landfill.
