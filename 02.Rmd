## Breaking the Vicious Cycle

Off the Grid is a food truck events company based in the Bay Area that hosts 70 weekly events in 26 cities.
As the company opens in new locations, a recurring issue at their grand opening events is tremendous event attendance met with insufficient food supply.
Food trucks struggle to predict attendance at these events, which are non-ticketed, outdoors and temporary. Because these are temporary events, Off the Grid does not have the advantage of constant physical presence, and therefore constant promotion, as brick-and-mortar locations. Furthermore, with no actual ticket sales prior to an event, the company can only depend on Facebook RSVPs to gauge attendance. Facebook RSVPs are generally correlated with attendance but are not accurate estimates. 

With every food truck that sells out, there’s a loss of revenue and a dire impact on customer retention as wait time increases and customer satisfaction diminishes. Using data science, Off the Grid can more precisely forecast attendance by incorporating more of the variables that affect event attendance so they can prepare vendors for the potential turnout and keep customers satisfied.


## Event Foresight

Introducing Event Foresight, a software solution that offers insight into the success of an event based on digital engagement factors and environmental variables. Its underlying algorithm is a regression model that takes into account factors including social media engagement, weather, location, vendor clout (online social influence based on followers) that have the potential to affect event turnouts and sales. Event Foresight integrates with social media and weather providers allowing easy tracking of social media activity and forecasted weather conditions in the event’s location. Furthermore, users can upload a file of social media accounts (i.e. Facebook, Twitter or Instagram) of vendors with whom they commonly partner for quick selection and assessment of potential clout around the event. With this prediction model, Off the Grid can generate an attendance forecast useful for key decision-making about the appropriate number of food trucks to schedule or the production level food trucks should be ready to serve at. This will ultimately maximize revenue and keep customer satisfaction high.


## Potential for More

The ability to forecast event attendance accurately can help Off the Grid avoid losing revenue at grand opening events and earn the company even more through customer retention.
Furthermore, Event Foresight could be applicable in many other fields, as it may also help law enforcement in forecasting crowd sizes to better estimate the number of security personnel required for an outdoor event.
